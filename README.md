# snedata
SNE Dataset Function for R

This package provides functions for generating simple simulation datasets 
for use in Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and related dimensionality reduction
methods, similar to those used by Lee and co-workers in their JSE papers.

Additionally, if you have the [RnavGraphImageData](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RnavGraphImageData/index.html)
package installed, there are also functions to convert the Olivetti and Frey 
faces datasets into a row-based dataframe and functions to visualize them.

### Installing:
```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jlmelville/snedata")
```

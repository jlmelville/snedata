\title{Toroidal Helix Data Set}
\usage{
helix(n = 1000, rmajor = 2, rminor = 1, nwinds = 8, nlabels = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of points to create.}

\item{rmajor}{Major radius.}

\item{rminor}{Minor radius.}

\item{nwinds}{Number of winds the helix makes.}

\item{nlabels}{Number of labels.}
}
\value{
Data frame.
}
\description{
Simulation data.
}
\details{
Creates a series of points sampled from a 3D helix with the ends joined
to each other.

Unlike \code{\link{ball}} and \code{\link{sphere}}, this data set is not
randomly sampled.

Labels go from \code{1} to \code{nlabels}. Points are classified into
equally-populated labels based on their z-coordinate.

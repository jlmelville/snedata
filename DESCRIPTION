Description: Some simple simulation datasets used in Stochastic Neighbor
    Embedding-related research, similar to those used by Lee and co-workers in
    their JSE papers. Additionally, functions for visualizing two image
    datasets: the Olivetti and Frey faces datasets. The latter requires the
    RnavGraphImageData package to be installed.

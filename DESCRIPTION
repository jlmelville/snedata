Description: Some simple simulation datasets used in Stochastic Neighbor
    Embedding-related research, similar to those used by Lee and co-workers in
    their JSE papers. Also, R translations of the JavaScript functions used to
    generate data for the article "How to Use t-SNE Effectively" at
    http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/. Additionally, three real-world image
    datasets: the Olivetti faces dataset, the Frey faces dataset and the MNIST
    digits dataset. Access to the Olivetti and Frey faces datasets requires the
    RnavGraphImageData package be installed. Access to the MNIST digits dataset
    requires a connection to the internet to download the files. There are
    also functions for visualizing individual images in these datasets.

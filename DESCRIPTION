Description: Some simple simulation datasets used in Stochastic Neighbor
    Embedding-related research, similar to those used by Lee and co-workers in
    their JSE papers. Also, R translations of the JavaScript functions used to
    generate data for the article "How to Use t-SNE Effectively" at
    http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/. Additionally, functions for
    visualizing two image datasets: the Olivetti and Frey faces datasets. The
    latter requires the RnavGraphImageData package to be installed.
